# Unstructured notes and ideas
All numbers are subject to tweaking and balancing

**Main currency:** notes ðŸŽ¶ (soft)  
**Secondary currency:** gems ðŸ’Ž (hard)  
**Tertiary currency:** _tbd_   (if $ value disassociation becomes relevant)

## Rating
character independant
card based quality
-> upgrade/improvement mechanics

Quality: 
- 1: bad
- 2: ok
- 3: good
- 4: great
- 5: epic
- 6: shiny

2 bad cards = 1 ok card
3 ok cards = 1 good card
4 good cards = 1 great card
5 great cards = 1 epic card

Shiny cards can only be dropped with 0.5% chance or upgraded using a store purchased item

## Entity relations and stuff
Single card of any character  
belongs to a band/group  
which could be part of their topmost genre (?)  

Completed bands reward cosmetics and XP (scaled to band size)

Band levels by collecting duplicates (?) as a long term hook

## Profile
Steal profile layout from Amaan
with more customization

## Other
Required
- detailed card history

Leaderboards
 - All time
 - Monthly (resets every 1st of the month to encourage conversion of non-whales)
Top positions get awarded additianal XP + Gems

Each collect += 10 XP (Shiny += 100)  
Each upgrade += 25 XP


Daily reward -> notes
Weekly reward -> gems  
Monthly reward -> Pack with 1 shiny card guaranteed (included)  
Each reward tier also grants XP

## Optional  
### Friends list  
could be used for a "social feed" outlining friends shiny drops and purchases (availability and social proof)

### referral system 
after a referred friend collects 100 cards, both get gems

### archievements as profile badges  
- [50, 100, 500, 1000, 10k] Cards collected  
- [100k, 500k, 1m] Notes spent total  
   - do not encourage saving
   - players with low funds (notes) could be targeted by high item discounts with a higher chance of conversion   

- [100, 500, 1k] Trades completed (Limit trades per hour? Pay for trade limit reset)

- [7d,1m,6m,1y] Daily streak
   - ties in to the social feed to apply pressure to friends to keep up

- [10,50,100] Shinies present in collection
- [5k, 10k, 100k] Bad/ok/good cards in collection (each q level separately)
   - Discourage converting cards to currency, purchase instead
